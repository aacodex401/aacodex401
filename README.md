# Hey, I'm Anderson 👋

**I turn AI experiments into revenue.** Fractional CPO for AI startups who need product leadership with skin in the game.

## 🎯 What I Do

I help AI startups ship products — not decks, not strategies, actual products that users pay for.

**Track record:**
- 📱 Shipped products used by **millions** (mobile apps, enterprise platforms)
- 💰 Built AI models that reduced **$300M in debt** for financial services
- 🚀 Grew **0→1 products** from PoC to production at scale
- 🧠 18 years across AI/ML, product, and engineering leadership

## 🔨 Currently Building

**[Abittus](https://github.com/aurascore)** — AI wellness platform with multi-agent coaching
- 3 specialized AI coaches with consensus voting architecture
- 847 waitlist signups (pre-launch)
- Integrations: Strava, Apple Health, Garmin

*Building in public to prove I practice what I preach.*

## 🛠 My Stack

**AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, LangChain, RAG, LLM Ops, Multi-Agent Systems  
**Systems:** FastAPI, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, Docker  
**Product:** Experimentation frameworks, KPI design, 0→1 methodology  
**Infra:** AWS, GCP, Kubernetes (when it's worth it)

## 🤝 Work With Me

I take on **2-3 AI startups at a time** as Fractional CPO — embedded leadership, not consulting.

**Best fit if you:**
- Have AI experiments but can't ship products
- Need someone who codes AND talks to investors
- Want product leadership without full-time hire

**How I work:**
- Equity/partnership model (aligned incentives)
- Hands-on building, not just advising
- Direct access, async-first
